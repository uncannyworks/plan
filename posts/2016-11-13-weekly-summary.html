<p>This was an interesting week full of various technical achievements. Unfortunately I did not manage to stay focused and achieve the goals I lined out last week.</p>

<h3 id="uncanny-works">Uncanny Works</h3>
<p>This blog update.</p>
<h3 id="hack-slash">Hack Slash</h3>
<p>While I do not recommend public consumption just yet, <a href="https://github.com/uncannyworks/hack-slash">Hack Slash</a> code is now available.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I did here was spend a little time getting the <code>HackM</code> monad working. This is quite simply a type synonym which wraps the <code>State</code> monad with a <code>Scene</code> and a polymorphic game type.</p>
<pre><code class="haskell">
type HackM a = State Scene a
</code></pre>
<p>The game developer shouldn’t have to worry about threading a <code>Scene</code> through their functions, which in the beginning I was doing until this new approach dawned on me. They can now use the new <code>HackM</code> monad which gives them access to <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> allowing them to grab and update the <code>Scene</code> only when desired.</p>
<pre><code class="haskell">
-- old way
oldNoSceneFunc :: GameLogic -> Scene -> (GameLogic, Scene) -- <-- terrible Scene threading
oldNoSceneFunc logic scene = (doThingsToGameLogic logic, scene)

oldSceneFunc :: GameLogic -> Scene -> (GameLogic, Scene)
oldSceneFunc logic scene = (doThingsToGameLogic logic, doThingsToScene Scene)

-- new HackM way

newNoSceneFunc :: GameLogic -> HackM GameLogic
newNoSceneFunc = return . doThingsToGameLogic

newSceneFunc :: GameLogic -> HackM GameLogic
newSceneFunc logic0 = do
  scene0 <- get
  put $ doThingsToScene scene0
  return $ doThingsToGameLogic logic0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="armored-bits">Armored Bits</h3>
<p>All of the work involved here was integrating the above <code>HackM</code> monad into the system.</p>
<p>This gave me a lot of insights into where I was doing some things terribly wrong, however, I’m currently pondering how to correctly handle 3 functions which don’t cleanly bridge the gap and as a result didn’t reach my goal of getting AB into a working state.</p>
<h3 id="five-minute-rl">Five Minute RL</h3>
<p>I’ve been obsessed with the idea of building a roguelike for years now, and continue to ask myself why I never just sat down and started one. In this case I finally had a concrete idea that is much smaller in scope than Prismatica (which is a full on world simulator), and can ideally get done in a reasonable amount of time, packaged up, and sold through various channels.</p>
<p>The majority of time spent here was importing and manipulating a large number of sprites to work in Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p>As usual Blueprint programming is kind a neat break from actual text based programming. I managed to get a basic random dungeon generator working in an afternoon yesterday.</p>
<p>I’ll discuss the core game play in a future blog post as development progresses a little further.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Primary goal is to get Armored Bits back into a 100% working state.</p>
<p>Secondary goal is to keep moving Five Minute Roguelike forward. I haven’t sat down and built a toy in quite a long time, so this has been a nice break.</p>
