title: Weekly Summary 2 - Ending 2016-11-06

This week was all over the board. Thursday was a national holiday in Japan, so I took Friday off to give myself a 4 day weekend. My time was divided between family responsibilities and juggling projects. I actually burned myself out so with the exception of this blog post I ended up just relaxing with my daughter all day Sunday.

### Uncanny Works

I spent a little over 10 hours importing assets from our originally planned Dungeon Slammers project (never released) and attempted to revive it inside Unreal Engine 4. I've tinkered with UE4 in the past so was able to make a goodly amount of progress, but there's quite a bit of work to take the game all the way to the final product we envisioned. I'm hanging this up for now, but it was a good experiment in wrapping my head around the engine more.

### Hack Slash

While No time was recorded, a small handful of improvements were introduced via work done on Armored Bits.

### Armored Bits

I finished reintegrating all of the code on top of Hack Slash and got it to build again. There are a handful of minor things which changed and still need refactored to get the game back into a working state, however, I'm happy with the progress which was made here this week. Should be back on track within the next week easily.

### Prismatica

No work was done this week on this project. This is fine as it's a tertiary long term project.

### Web Project

This was the result of wanting to finally poke at the Haskell web world. For the record I hate web programming, and I think writing APIs which connect to databases an absolute snooze fest. Still, I wanted to wrap my head around some of the available technology so I did end up blowing nearly 20 hours on this. I'm now familiar with [Servant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant), [Opaleye](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye), and [Lucid](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid).

## What's Next?

My primary goal for next week is to get Armored Bits back into a 100% working state.
